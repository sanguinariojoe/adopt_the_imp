# What is the IMP?

The IMP is a fascinating and playful entity, known for its delightful mischief.
It bestows unwavering stability upon any SPH practitioner clever enough to
unravel a conundrum --a fixed-point problem that eludes even the most
determined attempts of Newton's method.

# Why should I adopt an IMP?

The IMP offers several advantages that make it an attractive choice for SPH
simulations.

## Unconditional stability

One of the key benefits of the IMP method is its ability to ensure
unconditional stability in SPH models.
This is achieved through exact energy conservation, **which eliminates the need
for dissipation terms.**

Currently, the energy conservation property of the IMP method has been
demonstrated for compressible and Weakly-Compressible SPH formulations.
Ongoing theoretical work is also being conducted on Incompressible SPH.

## Spectral convergence

Although the IMP method requires solving a fixed-point problem, numerical
experiments have shown that the residues converge spectrally.

**An ideal scenario for numerical simulations**

In fact, the IMP method has been shown to outperform commonly used time
integrators in SPH, such as Improved-Euler and 4th order Runge-Kutta, with just
4 or 5 iterations.

## Easy to implement

Adopting the IMP method is relatively straightforward and requires minimal
additional code.

| Code | Core code lines | Other code lines |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [AQUAgpusph](https://aquagpusph.org/) | 116 | 33 |
| [TNL-SPH](https://gitlab.com/tnl-project/tnl-sph) | 337 | 0 |

Currently, [AQUAgpusph](https://aquagpusph.org/) and
[TNL-SPH](https://gitlab.com/tnl-project/tnl-sph) are the only IMP
adopters.
However, estimates are provided for other popular SPH implementations.
If you are a developer who has adopetd an IMP, please
[submit an issue](https://github.com/sanguinariojoe/adopt_the_imp/issues) so
that we can update the table.

Some details on how it is implemented on AQUAgpusph can be found [here](https://github.com/sanguinariojoe/adopt_the_imp/wiki/AQUAgpusph)
